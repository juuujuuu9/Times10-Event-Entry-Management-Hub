# Event Day — Staff Scanner Guide

## 🎯 Your Job

Scan QR codes to check in attendees as they arrive. If QR scanning fails, use manual lookup.

---

## 📱 Getting Started (2 minutes)

1. **Open the scanner page** on your phone
2. **Tap "Start Scanning"**
3. **Allow camera access** if prompted
4. **Test it** — scan your own QR code, or use the [Demo Codes](/demo-codes) page (Green/Yellow/Red test codes)

---

## ✅ How to Check Someone In

### The QR Scan (Normal Flow)

1. Ask attendee to show their QR code
2. Ask them to **maximize screen brightness**
3. Hold your phone **4-6 inches** from their screen
4. Keep steady for 1-2 seconds
5. Wait for the **beep/flash** confirmation

**Green = Success** — Attendee is checked in  
**Yellow = Already checked in** — Show them their check-in time  
**Red = Problem** — Try again or use manual lookup

### Manual Lookup (When QR Fails)

1. Tap **"Manual Lookup"**
2. Ask for their **name or email**
3. Type it in
4. Tap their name when it appears
5. Tap **"Check In"**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Try This |
|---------|----------|
| Won't scan | Ask them to max brightness |
| Still won't scan | Adjust distance (closer/farther) |
| Glare on screen | Tilt either phone slightly |
| Cracked screen | Use manual lookup |
| "Invalid QR" | Use manual lookup, tell admin |
| Camera won't start | Check browser permissions |
| No internet | Keep scanning — it will sync later |

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules

**DO:**
- ✅ Check brightness first when QR won't scan
- ✅ Use manual lookup if scanning fails after 2 tries
- ✅ Be polite — some attendees are confused by the tech
- ✅ Keep scanning even if wifi drops (offline mode works)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Check in someone without scanning or manual lookup
- ❌ Let attendees check themselves in on your phone
- ❌ Panic if the scanner acts up — manual lookup always works
- ❌ Close the browser — you'll stay logged in

## 🆘 Emergency Contacts

**Tech issues:** [Your Name] — [Your Phone]  
**Registration problems:** [Admin Name] — [Admin Phone]

---

## 📊 Quick Stats

You can see:
- Total checked in today
- Last check-in time
- If you're in offline mode

Offline mode = Your check-ins will sync when wifi returns. Keep scanning!

## 🎓 Pro Tips

💡 **The sweet spot is 4-6 inches** — About the width of your hand  
💡 **Glare is the enemy** — Fluorescent lights overhead cause problems  
💡 **Cracked screens** — Don't waste time, go straight to manual lookup  
💡 **Smudges matter** — Ask them to wipe their screen if it's greasy  
💡 **Stay charged** — Bring a battery pack, you'll be using your phone all day

---

## 📝 End of Shift

1. Make sure you're back online (if you were offline)
2. Wait for "Sync complete" message if there were queued check-ins
3. Close the browser tab
4. Report any issues to the admin

---

**Remember:** The goal is smooth entry. If QR scanning is slow, switch to manual lookup. Speed matters more than using the fancy tech.
